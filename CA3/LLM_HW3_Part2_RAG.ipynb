        "    We need to use RAG primarily to address the inherent limitations of standalone Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs are trained on a fixed dataset, meaning their knowledge is static and quickly becomes outdated concerning recent events or niche information. They also suffer from a tendency to \"hallucinate,\" generating plausible but factually incorrect information. Furthermore, LLMs have a limited context window, preventing them from directly processing an entire large knowledge base. RAG overcomes these issues by allowing LLMs to retrieve relevant, up-to-date information from an external corpus and use it to ground their responses, thereby reducing hallucinations and providing more accurate and verifiable answers.\n",

It offers a modular set of components that facilitate working with LLMs, including connecting them to external data sources, integrating various tools, and constructing complex \"chains\" and \"agents\". For building RAG pipelines, LangChain provides the structural backbone to seamlessly integrate the \"Retriever\" and \"Generator\" components. It simplifies the process of fetching relevant documents, passing them as context to the LLM, and managing the overall flow from user query to model response, making the development of sophisticated RAG systems more streamlined and efficient."
